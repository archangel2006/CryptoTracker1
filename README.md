# 🧪 CryptoTracker1

This repository contains **initial explorations, test files, and experimental implementations** created during the early development phase of [CryptoPulse](https://github.com/archangel2006/CryptoPulse).

## 🚧 Status
This is not an active or production-ready project. It was used as a sandbox to test:
- API integrations
- UI/UX experiments
- Data fetching logic
- Graph rendering trials

## 📁 Why This is here?
- To show the **development journey** behind CryptoPulse.
- To retain a history of failed attempts, alternate directions, and test files.
- To help others who may want to see how a polished project evolves from a messy start.
